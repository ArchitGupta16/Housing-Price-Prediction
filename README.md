# Housing-Price-Prediction

Worked on a housing prices dataset from Kaggle, which consisted of 81 variables to predict the price of houses. Applied statistical methods and performed EDA to filter the irrelevant and redundant features from the data, eliminating 44 variables. Achieved a R2 score of 0.9 in the modeling phase to predict the prices using Random Forest.
